I'm
every
star
that's
in
your
sky
Every
glimmer
shining
through
your
eyes
The
darkest
night
I'll
be
your
guide
Just
to
give
you
peace
of
mind
Oh
I
used
to
get
nowhere
to
stand
But
I
finally
found
a
place
to
land
Rainbow
through
the
rain
Laughter
through
all
these
pains

You're
like
the
blood
through
all
my
veins
I'd
like
to
say
I'll
love
you
night
and
day
Forever
by
your
side
I'll
stay
I'll
never
turn
away
Your
every
wish
is
my
command
You're
my
perfect
plan
And
I'll
be
loving
you
the
best
I
can
Cos'
I'm
your
faithful
man
Cos'
I'm
your
faithful
man
