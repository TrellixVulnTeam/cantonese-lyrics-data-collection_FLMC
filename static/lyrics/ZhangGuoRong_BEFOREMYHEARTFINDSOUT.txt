Well
you
woke
me
from
a
dream
about
you
Just
to
say
that
you
were
leavin'
I'm
sleepy
but
I
though
that
you
said
our
love
That
would
last
forever
is
endin'
Well
before
you
walk
out
of
my
life
Would
you
be
specially
quiet
Don't
you
let
my
heart
know
that
you're
leavin'
Don't
you
say
another
word
about
it
darlin'
Don't
you
let
my
heart
your
footsteps
Walkin'
out
the
door
of
my
hopes
and
dreams

And
don't
you
let
my
heart
know
that
you're
leavin'
Don't
you
say
another
word
about
it
darlin'
Leave
me
now,
before
my
heart
finds
it
Well,
I
see
you
writing
somethin'
down
And
leavin'
it
on
the
dresser
The
tears
in
your
eyes
look
a
lot
like
mine
But
I
guess
it's
all
for
the
better
Well,
before
we
say
our
last
goodbye
Baby,
won't
you
hold
me
just
one
more
time
