Yim
Streets
of
Berlin
I
must
leave
you
soon
Ah!
Will
you
forget
me?
Was
I
really
here?
Find
me
a
bar,
On
the
cobblestoned
streets
Where
the
boys
are
pretty.
I
can
not
love
For
more
than
one
day
But
one
day
is
enough
in
this
city.

Find
me
a
boy
With
two
ocean
blue
eyes
And
show
him
no
pity.
Take
out
his
eyes
He
never
needs
to
see
How
they
eat
you
alive
in
this
city.
Streets
of
Berlin
I
must
leave
you
soon
Streets
of
Berlin
Do
you
care?
Streets
of
Berlin
Will
you
cry
out
If
I
vanish
into
thin
air?
