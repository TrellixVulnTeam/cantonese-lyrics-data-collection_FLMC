My
gift
is
my
song
and
this
one
is
for
you
You
can
tell
everybody
this
is
your
song
I
hope
you
don't
mind,
hope
you
don't
mind
that
I
put
down
in
words
How
wonderful
life
is
while
you're
in
the
world
It's
a
little
bit
funny
this
feeling
inside
I'm
not
one
of
those
who
can
easily
hide
I
don't
have
much
money
but
boy
if
I
did
I'd
buy
a
big
house
where
we
both
could
live
If
I
was
a
sculptor,
but
then
again,
no

Or
a
man
who
makes
potions
in
a
travelling
show
I
know
it's
not
much
but
it's
the
best
I
can
do
My
gift
is
my
song
and
this
one
is
for
you
And
you
can
tell
everybody
this
is
your
song
It
may
be
quite
simple
but
now
that
it's
done
I
hope
you
don't
mind,
hope
you
don't
mind
that
I
put
down
in
words
How
wonderful
life
is
while
you're
in
the
world
Hope
you
don't
mind,
hope
you
don't
mind
that
I
put
down
in
words
How
wonderful
life
is
while
you're
in
the
world
Hope
you
don't
mind,
hope
you
don't
mind
that
I
put
down
in
words
How
wonderful
life
is
while
you're
in
the
world
