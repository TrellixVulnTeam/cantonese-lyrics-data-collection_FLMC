I
like
dreamin'
Cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
dreamin'
close
my
eyes
and
feelin'
fine
When
the
lights
go
down
I'm
holding
you
so
tight
Gotcha
in
my
arms
and
it's
paradise
Till
the
morning
light
I
see
us
on
the
shore
beneath
the
bright
sunshine
We've
walked
along
St.Thmoas
Beach
a
million
times
Hand
in
hand
two
lovers
kissin'
in
the
sand
Side
by
side
the
tide
rolls
in
I'm
touching
you,
you
touching
me
If
only
it
could
be
I
like
dreamin'
Cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
dreamin'
close
my
eyes
and
feelin'
fine
When
the
lights
go
down
I'm
holding
you
so
tight
Gotcha
in
my
arms
and
it's
paradise
Till
the
morning
light
Through
each
dream
how
our
love
has
grown

I
see
us
with
our
children
and
our
happy
home
Little
smile
so
warm
and
terder
lookin'
up
at
us
Bless
by
love
the
world
we
share
until
I
wake
I
reach
for
you
and
you're
just
not
there
I
like
dreamin'
cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
holdin'
you
close
touchin'
your
skin
Even
if
it's
in
my
mind
I
like
dreamin'
cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
dreamin'
close
my
eyes
and
feelin'
fine
I
like
dreamin'
Cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
dreamin'
close
my
eyes
and
feelin'
fine
I
like
dreamin'
Cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
I
like
dreamin'
close
my
eyes
and
feelin'
fine
I
like
dreamin'
cause
dreamin'
can
make
you
mine
