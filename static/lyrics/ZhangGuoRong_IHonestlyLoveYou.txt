Lyrics：Allen/Barry
Music：Allen/Barry
Maybe
I
hang
around
here
a
little
more
than
I
should
We
both
know
I
got
somewhere
else
to
go
But
I
got
something
to
tell
you
that
I
never
thought
I
would
But
I
believe
you
really
ought
to
know
I
love
you
I
honestly
love
you
You
don't
have
to
answer
I
see
it
in
your
eyes
Maybe
it
was
better
left
unsaid
But
this
is
pure
and
simple,
and
you
must
realise
That
it's
comin'
from
my
heart
and
not
my
head
I
Love
You,
I
honestly
love
you

I'm
not
tryin'
to
make
you
feel
uncomfortable
I'm
not
tryin'
to
make
you
anything
at
all
But
this
feeling
doesn't
come
along
everyday
And
you
shouldn't
blow
the
chance
when
you've
got
the
chance
to
say
I
love
you
I
love
you,
I
honestly
love
you
If
we
both
were
born
in
another
place
and
time
This
moment
might
be
ending
in
a
kiss
But
there
you
are
with
yours,
and
here
I
am
with
mine
So
I
guess
we'll
just
be
leavin'
it
at
this
I
love
you,
I
honestly
love
you
I
honestly
love
you
