Oh
,you
′re
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
Oh
,you
′re
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
It
′s
something
I
think
′s
worth
smile
If
the
puppet
makes
you
smile
If
not
,then
you′re
throwing
stones
Throwing
the
stones
Oh
,it′s
a
funny
game
Don′t
believe
that′s
all
the
thing
Can′t
think
what
I′ve
just
said
But
there′s
something
upon
my
head
Millions
of
eyes
can
see
Yet
why
am
I
so
blind
When
the
someone
else
is
me

It′s
unkind.
it′s
unkind
It′s
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
you
′re
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
It
′s
something
I
think
′s
worth
smile
If
the
puppet
makes
you
smile
If
not,
then
you′re
throwing
stones
Throwing
stones,
throwing
stones
Oh
,
you
′re
a
holiday
Everyday
such
a
holiday
Now
it′s
my
turn
to
say
And
I
say
you′re
a
holiday
Oh
,you
′re
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
Oh
,you
′re
a
holiday
such
a
holiday
