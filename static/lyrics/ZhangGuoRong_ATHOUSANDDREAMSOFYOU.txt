Oh,
It's
time
to
dream
,
a
thousand
dreams
of
you
!
It's
been
so
grand
together,
yes
,
together
.
You
thrilled
me
from
the
start
.
You
brought
the
spring
again
.
Your
fingers
touched
the
strings
of
my
heart
and
made
it
sing
again
.
I
hope
you
dream
a
thousand
dreams
of
me
.
All
things
we're
planed
doing
together
.
And
if
you
do,
I
dream
my
whole
life
through
.
A
thousand
,
a
million
,
a
zillion
dreams
of
you
!
