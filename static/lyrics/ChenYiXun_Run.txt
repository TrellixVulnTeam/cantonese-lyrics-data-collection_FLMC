Last
night
I
had
a
dream
That
I
was
on
an
endless
run
I
wasn't
tired
I
wasn't
scared
I
couldn't
stop
but
I
didn't
care
I
ran
through
the
night
I
ran
through
the
rain
I
ran
and
ran
till
everything
looked
the
same
And
it
was
then
I
passed
the
lake
At
your
reflection,
I
turned
to
ask
Can
anyone
tell
That
I
am
lost

Can
anyone
tell
That
I
am
naked
before
you
That
I
am
burning
for
you
So
there
you
were
and
I
knew
it
was
over
However
beautiful
however
mad
Before
I
wake
I
just
had
to
ask
Do
you
remember
why
you're
here
Do
you
remember
what
What
in
the
world
were
you
after
Or
were
you
running
away
somehow
I
woke
up
both
happy
and
sad
A
little
sorry
a
little
glad
