just
when
I
needed
you
most
You
packed
in
the
morning
I
Stared
out
the
window
I
Struggled
for
something
to
say
You
left
in
the
rain
without
closing
the
door
I
didn't
stand
in
your
way
Now
I
miss
you
more
than
I
Missed
you
before
and
now
Where
I'll
find
comfort
god
knows
Cuz
you,
left
me,
just
when
I
needed
you
most
Now
most
every
morning
I
Stare
out
the
window
I
Think
about
where
you
might
be
I've
written
letters
that
I'd
like
to
send
If
you
would
just
send
one
to
me

Cuz
I
need
you
more
than
I've
Needed
before
and
now
Where
I'll
find
comfort
god
knows
Cuz
you,
left
me,
You
packed
in
the
morning
I
Struggled
for
something
to
say
You
left
in
the
rain
without
closing
the
door
I
didn't
stand
in
your
way
Now
I
love
you
more
than
I
Loved
you
before
and
now
Where
I'll
find
comfort
,
god
knows
Cuz
you
,
left
me
,
just
when
I
needed
you
most
Oh
no
you
left
me
just
when
I
needed
you
most
You
left
me
just
when
I
needed
you
most
