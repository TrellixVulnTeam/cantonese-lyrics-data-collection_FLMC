I
have
he
sign,
all
the
signs
of
I
have
he
sign,
all
the
signs
of
I
have
he
sign,
all
the
signs
of
Loving
You!
I
can't
think
no
I
can't
sleep
You'll
find
me
waitingoutside
your
door
I'm
weak
and
weary
to
the
point
of
tearing
wondering
if
you'll
ever
come
home
Oh
I
don't
know

I
miss
your
kindness
where
do
I
find
this
Realizing
that
I'll
never
find
the
same
girl
So
understanding.
Never
demanding.
There's
no
wonder,
how
I
ever
got
this
way
My
heart
explodes,
and
I'm
so
exposed
and
everyone
knows
something's
wrong
Your
alibi
just
made
me
cry
I
can't
spend
another
night
alone.
And
now
I
know
