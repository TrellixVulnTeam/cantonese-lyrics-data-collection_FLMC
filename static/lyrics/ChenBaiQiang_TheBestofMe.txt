(女)So
many
years
gone
Still
I
remember
How
did
I
ever
let
my
heart
believe
In
one
who
never
gave
enough
to
me
(男)And
so
many
years
gone
With
love
that
was
so
wrong
(合)I
can't
forget
the
way
it
used
to
be
(男)And
how
you
changed
the
taste
of
love
for
me
(合)You
were
my
one
more
chance
I
never
thought
I'd
find
You
were
the
one
moment
I'll
always
have
in
my
mind
(男)No
one
will
ever
touch
me
more
(合)And
I
only
hope
that
in
return

I
might
have
saved
the
best
of
me
for
you
(男)And
we'll
have
no
ending
If
we
can
hold
on
(合)And
I
think
I've
come
this
far
because
of
you
Could
be
no
other
love
but
yours
will
do
You
were
my
one
more
chance
I
never
thought
I'd
find
You
were
the
one
moment
I'll
always
have
in
my
mind
(女)No
one
will
ever
touch
me
more
(合)And
I
only
hope
that
in
return
I
might
have
saved
the
best
of
me
for
you
(女)No
one
will
ever
touch
me
more
(男)And
I
only
hope
that
in
return
(合)No
matter
how
much
we
have
to
learn
I
might
have
saved
the
best
of
me
for
you
