I
believe
that
love
has
gone
Had
no
strength
to
carry
on
Thought
me
world
was
upside
down
Then
you
walked
onto
my
life
Went
to
work
to
set
things
right
What's
the
secret
that
you
that
you
used
You
made
me
believe
in
magic
You
know
that
I
can
be
true
to
your
love
You
made
me
believe
in
magic

Your
love
put
magic
into
my
life
Now
I'm
filled
with
a
new
sense
to
be
You
gave
my
life
harmony
Lovin'
you
will
all
I,
all
I
need
You
made
me
believe
in
magic
You
know
that
I
can
be
true
to
your
love
You
made
me
believe
in
magic
Your
love
put
magic
into
my
life
