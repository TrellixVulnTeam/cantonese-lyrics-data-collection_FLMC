I
know
that
you've
been
watching
over
me
you've
up
so
high,
the
brightest
in
the
sky
you
know
that
every
night
I
pray
my
soul
for
you
tomorrow
won't
be
as
blue
girl
I
hope
you
can
understand
that
the
sun
will
always
shine
again
now
that
you've
found
your
way
onto
a
better
day
You'll
shine
again
You'll
shine
again
Give
you
strength
and
love
to
fight
the
days
ahead
I
see
the
light
See
a
rainbow
See
the
beauty
that's
within
you
You'll
shine
again
You
are
so
beautiful
