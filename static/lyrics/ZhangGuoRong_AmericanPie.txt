A
long
long
time
ago
I
can
still
remember
How
that
music
used
to
make
me
smile
And
I
knew
if
I
had
my
chance
That
I
could
make
those
people
dance
And
maybe
they'd
be
happy
for
a
while
Did
you
write
the
book
of
love
And
do
you
have
faith
in
God
above
If
the
Bible
tells
you
so?
Now
do
you
believe
in
rock
and
roll?
And
Can
music
save
your
mortal
soul?
And
can
you
teach
me
how
to
dance
real
slow?
Well,
I
know
that
you're
in
love
with
him
'cause
I
saw
you
dancing
in
the
gym
You
both
kicked
off
your
shoes
Man,
I
dig
those
rhythm
and
blues
I
was
a
lonely
teenage
broncin'
buck
With
a
pink
carnation
and
a
pickup
truck
But
I
knew
I
was
out
of
luck
The
day
the
music
died
I
started
singing(*)
Now,
for
ten
years
we've
been
on
our
own
And
moss
grows
fat
on
a
rolling
stone
But
that's
not
how
it
used
to
be
When
the
jester
sang
for
the
king
and
queen

In
a
coat
he
borrowed
from
James
Dean
And
a
voice
that
came
from
you
and
me
Oh
and
while
the
king
was
looking
down
The
jester
stole
his
thorny
crown
The
courtroom
was
adjourned
No
verdict
was
returned
And
while
Lenin
read
a
book
on
Marx
The
quartet
practiced
in
the
park
And
we
sang
dirges
in
the
dark
The
day
the
music
died
We
were
singing(*)

I
met
a
girl
who
sang
the
blues
And
I
asked
her
for
some
happy
news
But
she
just
smiled
and
turned
away
I
went
down
to
the
sacred
store
Where
I'd
heard
the
music
years
before
But
the
man
there
said
the
music
wouldn't
play
And
in
the
streets
the
children
screamed
The
lovers
cried,
and
the
poets
dreamed
But
not
a
word
was
spoken
The
church
bells
all
were
broken
And
the
three
men
I
admire
most
the
Father,
Son,
and
the
Holy
Ghost
They
caught
the
last
train
for
the
coast
The
day
the
music
died
And
they
were
singing(*)
