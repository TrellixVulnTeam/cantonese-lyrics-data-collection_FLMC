Remember
that
piano,
so
deligntful,
unusual.
That
classic
sensation,
sentimental,
confusion.
Used
to
say,
I
like
Chopin.
Love
me
now
and
again.
Oh~
Rainy
days
never
say
goodbye
to
desire
when
we
are
together.
Rainy
days
growing
in
your
eyes
tell
me
where's
always.
Imagine
your
face
in
a
sunshine
reflection.
A
vision
of
blue
skies
forever
distraction.
