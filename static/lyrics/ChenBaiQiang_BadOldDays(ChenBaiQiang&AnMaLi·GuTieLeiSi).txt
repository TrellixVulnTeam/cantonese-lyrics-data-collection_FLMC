(女)Remember
me
I
was
tossed
and
turnin'
Like
a
ship
without
a
sea
I
was
lost
for
learnin'
Like
a
song
without
a
key
(男)Remember
when
I
was
all
alone
Without
a
soul
to
call
my
friend
Who'd
have
thought
those
days
Would
ever
end
(合)Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Before
I
had
your
love
to
guide
me
Sad
old
days
(齊)You
set
me
free
(合)From
all
those
had
old
days
You
put
all
the
good
inside
of
me
Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Before
I
had
you
there
besides
me
Sad
old
days
And
can't
you
see
(齊)Can't
you
see
(合)You
took
the
had
old
days
And
you
put
all
the
good
inside
of
me
(女)Remember
who
Walked
into
my
life
And
put
their
foot
inside
my
shoe
Now
what
was
just
a
place
For
one
is
home
for
two

(男)Remember
why
I'm
gonna
stay
with
you
Untll
the
day
I
die
We
can
watch
the
good
old
days
go
by
(合)Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Before
I
had
your
love
to
guide
me
Sad
old
days
You
set
me
free
(齊)Set
me
free
(合)From
all
those
bad
old
days
You
put
all
the
good
inside
of
me
(女)Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Before
I
had
you
there
beside
me
Sad
old
days
And
can't
you
see
(齊)Can't
you
see
(合)You
took
the
bad
old
days
And
you
put
all
the
good
inside
of
me
Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Those
were
the
bad
old
days
You
put
all
the
good
inside
of
me
Those
were
the
bad
old
days
Ah
Those
were
the
bad
old
days
You
put
all
the
