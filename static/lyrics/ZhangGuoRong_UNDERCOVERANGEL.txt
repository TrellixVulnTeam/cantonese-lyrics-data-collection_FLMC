O'day

O'day
Crying
on
my
pillow
Lonely
in
my
bed
Then
I
heard
a
voice
beside
me
And
she
sofely
said
'Wonder
is
your
dream.'
And
as
I
held
her
She
said:'see
what
I
mean'
I
said
'what?'
She
said
'Ooh!Ooh!Wea!'
I
said
'Alright!'
She
said
'Love
me,Love
me,
Love
me'
Undercover
angel
Midnight
fantasy
I
never
had
a
dream
that
made
me
sweat
love
to
me
Undercover
angel
answer
to
my
prayer
You
made
me
know
that
there's
a
love
for
me
out
there
Somewhere,
Yeah,
somewhere
Heavenly
surrender
Sweet
after
glow
I've
given
up,
my
heart
to
you
Now
angel
don't
go
She
said
'Go
find
the
right
one
Love
her
and
then

When
you
look
into
her
eyes
You'll
see
me
again'
Now
you
know
my
story
And
girl
if
it's
right
I'm
gonna
take
you
in
my
arms
And
love
you
tonight
Underneath
the
covers
the
answer
lies
I'm
looking
for
my
angel
in
your
sweet
loving
eyes
She
said
'What?'
I
said
'Ooh!Ooh!Wea!'
She
said
'Alright!'
I
said
'make
sweet
love
to
me'
She
said
'What?'
I
said
'Ooh!Ooh!Wea!'
She
said
'Alright!'
I
said
'Love
me,Love
me,
Love
me'
Undercover
angel
Midnight
fantasy
I
never
had
a
dream
that
made
me
sweat
love
to
me
Undercover
angel
answer
to
my
prayer
You
made
me
know
that
there's
a
love
for
me
Love
me,Love
me,
Love
me.
