Remember
when
I
was
younger
Thinking
bout
all
the
fancy
things
Dreaming
bout
what
I'll
become
And
all
my
foolish
fantasies
Now
that
I
look
back
They
seem
to
me
so
funny
But
every
time
I
close
my
eyes
I
wanna
run
away
Wanna
go
back
to
that
place
Where
we
can
share
our
feelings
I
think
I
still
got
A
place
for
All
my
dreams
and
fantasies
Even
though
I
may
be
Too
late
for
anything
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Still
got
passion
in
my
bloodstream
Hope
I'm
not
too
late
Wanna
make
a
change
Don't
want
to
waste
my
life
away
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Life
is
filled
with
surprise
I
just
wanna
do
the
things
I
like

I
wanna
run
away
Wanna
go
back
to
that
place
Where
we
can
share
our
feelings
I
think
I
still
got
A
place
for
All
my
dreams
and
fantasies
Even
though
I
may
be
Too
late
for
anything
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Still
got
passion
in
my
bloodstream
Hope
I'm
not
too
late
Wanna
make
a
change
Don't
want
to
waste
my
life
away
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Life
is
filled
with
surprise
I
just
wanna
do
the
things
I
like
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Still
got
passion
in
my
bloodstream
Hope
I'm
not
too
late
Wanna
make
a
change
Don't
want
to
waste
my
life
away
Wanna
chase
my
dreams
All
the
fancy
things
Life
is
filled
with
surprise
I
just
wanna
do
the
things
I
like
