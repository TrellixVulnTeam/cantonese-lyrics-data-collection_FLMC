Rainfalls
in
the
evening
and
you
come
and
see
me
I
hold
your
hands
and
you
put
your
Lips
on
me
They
said
that
I'm
too
crazy
for
you
Lady
But
they
don't
see
how
you
kiss
me
loving
me
*Cloudy
days
Rainny
days
Stormy
days
Are
quite
Okay
Oh
that's
the
case
Baby
when
I
see
your
face
Cloudy
days
Rainny
days
Stormy
days

Are
quite
Okay
Oh
let
me
tell
you
babe
I'd
really
love
you
to
stay*
Love
is
a
mystery
and
only
the
blind
can
see
Who
would
had
thought
Love
would
shine
on
a
fool
like
me
When
I
feel
lonely
and
you
come
and
save
me
You
set
me
free
Show
me
how
sweet
Life
can
be
Repeat**
