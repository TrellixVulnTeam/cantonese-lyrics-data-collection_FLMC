Loving
you
is
easy
cuz
you're
beautiful
Making
love
with
you
is
all
I
wanna
do
Loving
you
is
more
than
just
a
dream
come
true
Cuz
everything
that
I
do
is
out
of
loving
you
La
la
la...
No
one
else
can
make
me
feel
the
colors
that
you
bring
Stay
with
me
while
we
grow
old
And
we
will
live
each
day
in
springtime
Loving
you
has
made
my
life
so
beautiful
Everyday
of
my
life
is
filled
with
loving
you
Loving
you
I
see
your
soul
come
shining
thru

Everytime
that
we...
ooh
I'm
more
in
love
with
you
La
la
la...
