Lyrics：馮德倫

Arranger：王雙駿
Season
changing
Another
year
goes
by
too
slow
Blurry
memories
Must
be
getting
old
Too
much
pot
and
heroine
Too
much
crack
and
coke
I
am
waiting
devastating
oh
*Anytime
at
all
Just
hear
this
song
Any
days
too
long

Just
turn
it
on
With
or
without
me
holding
you
at
all*
Repeat
*
Take
a
pink
one
Pick
a
red
one
Sir
Devil
Give
me
a
reason
To
be
standing
tall
Could
you
wake
me
from
misery
Don't
wanna
be
alone
Walls
are
closing
I
am
floating
oh
Repeat
*
*
*
*
