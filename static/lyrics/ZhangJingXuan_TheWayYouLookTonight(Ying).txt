your'e
lovely
with
your
smile
so
warm
and
your
cheeks
so
soft
there
is
nothing
for
me
but
to
love
you
and
the
way
you
look
tonight
with
each
word
your
tenderness
grows
tearing
my
fear
apart
and
that
laugh
that
wrinkles
your
nose
it
touches
my
foolish
heart
your'e
so
lovely
never
ever
never
gone
change

keep
that
breathless
charm
won't
you
please
arrange
it
cause
I
love
you
just
the
way
you
look
tonight

you
look
tonight
