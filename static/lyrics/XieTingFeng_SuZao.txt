天空跟海闊
即管去走
懶理會指責
已聽夠
不喜歡請你
別來聽候
我要誰來限制我自由
我受夠
Staring
at
them
stars
I
could
reach
it
There
goes
shooting
stars
Positive
I
can
catch
it
I
run
I
hustle
every
day
of
my
life
Got
something
to
say?
You
have
every
right
History
in
the
making
Records
renewing
Appearance
to
the
audience
Tell
them
what
it's
all
about
from
what
I
do
not
what
I
say
Watch
it
burn
and
burn
yeh
誰替代我
去塑造我
誰再囉唆
就劈開這枷鎖
由我造我
你看清楚
隨意穿梭
像滿天的星火
別妄想可管我
祝福不需要
祝得太好
我有權不去
看分數
輸得起只要
自行我路
以信念描劃著我地圖
我做到

誰替代我

就劈開這枷鎖
由我造我
你看清楚
隨意穿梭
像滿天的星火
別妄想可管我
行下去
即使失去
即使再累
但至少
入睡前能面對
那個自己
當天我一心
要追
誰替代我
去塑造我
誰再囉唆
就劈開這枷鎖
由我造我
你看清楚
隨意穿梭
像滿天的星火
別妄想可管我
Don't
let
them
words
control
my
path
Ambition
Be
my
other
half
I
run
I
hustle
every
day
of
my
life
Got
something
to
say?
You
have
every
right
Never
did
I
regret
Choice
I
made
Aye
Risks
that
I
take
All
the
memories
we
made
Accelerating
we
can
take
out
the
brake
Going
non-stop
No
time
to
wait
別要給我結果
別妄想可管我
