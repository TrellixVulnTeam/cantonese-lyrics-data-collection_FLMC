Dreaming
,I
must
be
dreaming
Or
am
I
really
lying
here
with
you
Baby
,
you
take
me
in
your
arms
And
though
u
am
wide
awake
I
know
my
dream
is
coming
true
And
though
I
just
fall
in
love
again
Just
one
touch
an
then
it
happens
every
time

And
there
I
go
I
just
fall
in
love
again
And
when
I
do
I
can't
help
myself
I
fall
in
love
with
you
Magic
,
it
must
be
magic
The
way
I
hold
you
and
the
night
just
seem
to
fly
Easy
,
for
you
to
take
me
to
a
star
Heaven
is
that
moment
when
I
look
in
your
eyes
