Hey
baby
I'm
sorry
I
never
meant
to
hurt
you
Please
don't
go
Slowly
my
eyes
began
to
see
That
I
need
you
near
right
with
me
at
all
times,
yeah
My
feelings
are
so
deep
for
you
That
I
won't
let
go,
oooh
no,
of
you
BRIDGE:
I
can't
let
this
love
(Slip
away)
And
I
can't
turn
it
around
(you
will
see)
And
only
then.....
CHORUS:
Please
don't
go
away
from
me
(I'll
be
there
for
you)
When
you
call
my
name
(call
my
name)
I'll
reach
out
my
hand
to
you
(And
I'll
welcome
you)
To
my
heart
(my
future
my
heart)
Please
don't
go
away
from
me
We
can
work
it
out

Whatever
it
may
be
girl
Please
don't
go(no,no,no,no,no,please
don't
go)
You
know,
It's
not
often
that
we
see
each
other,
That's
why
I
cherish
every
moment
that
we
spent
with
each
other
When
you're
away,
Temptation
may
come
Above
of
when
I
get
caught
up
(by
you),
I
let
go
Thinking
about
you
each
day
I
feel
(I
love
you
and
I'll
never
let
go)
Your
love
makes
my
head
spin
round
and
round
in
a
daze,
yeah
oh
baby
REPEAT
BRIDGE
REPEAT
CHORUS
Please
don't
go
away
I'll
be
there,
I'll
be
right
there
