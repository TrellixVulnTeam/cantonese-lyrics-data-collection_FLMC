I'm
dreaming
of
a
white
X'mas
Just
like
the
ones
I
used
to
know
Where
the
treetops
glisten
And
children
listen
To
hear
sleigh
bells
in
the
snow

I'm
dreaming
of
a
white
X'mas
With
every
X'mas
card
I
write
May
your
days
be
merry
and
bright
And
may
all
your
X'mases
be
white
May
your
days
be
merry
and
bright
And
may
all
your
X'mas
May
all
your
X'mas
And
may
all
your
X'mases
be
white
