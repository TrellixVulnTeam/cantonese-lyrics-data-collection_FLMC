The
highway
lies
between
us
The
things
we
said
that
we
must
The
raving
disillusion
of
the
things
we
almost
did
but
like
the
rocky
road
that
twists
and
turns
Where's
end
Where
is
the
ending
of
our
song
The
love
you
gave
to
me
is
so
ture
I
hope
it
lasts
forever
dear
Life
is
running
short
Don't
waste
our
tears
You
are
the
one
I'll
love
in
all
my
years
The
moment
when
I
need
you
I
think
It's
time
I
miss
you
Feelings
that
are
reside
me
I
know
I
can't
live
without
you
Take
my
hands
and
let
me
hold
you
for
one
more
time
Let
our
minds
fly
to
the
ending
of
our
time
