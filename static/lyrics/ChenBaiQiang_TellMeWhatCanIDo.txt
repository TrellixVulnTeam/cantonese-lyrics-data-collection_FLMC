(男)You
and
I
We've
been
together
for
such
a
long
time
I
got
so
used
to
you
There're
so
much
that
we've
been
through
I
still
love
you
(女)There
were
days
I
thought
for
sure
we'd
thrown
it
away
Who
was
right
who
was
wrong
It
didn't
matter
We
just
belong
together
(合)Tell
me
what
Can
I
do
I
need
you
right
here
beside
me
(男)Please
don't
tell
me
we're
through
(合)Tell
Me
What
Can
I
Do
To
make
you
stay
(女)Can't
we
try

There
must
be
someway
we
can't
say
goodbye
(男)You
know
I
need
you
right
now
Let's
stay
together
we'll
work
it
out
I
still
love
you
(合)Tell
Me
What
Can
I
Do
I
need
you
right
here
beside
me
How
can
you
tell
me
we're
through
Tell
me
what
can
I
do
(女)I'm
not
good
at
begging
(男)I
always
had
my
pride
(合)But
there's
no
denying
I
need
you
deep
inside
Tell
Me
What
Can
I
Do
I
need
you
right
here
beside
me
How
can
you
tell
me
we're
through
Tell
me
what
can
I
do
