in
the
air
in
the
night
All
around
you
Warm
love
surrounds
you
Like
the
ocean
surrounds
the
shore
Warm
in
your
eyes
As
you
reach
out
to
hold
me
Warm
love
enfolds
me
makes
me
yours
Forever
more
Warm
so
warm
As
I
just
lie
inside
your
love
so
warm
Tenderly
like
the
breeze
moving
over
me

So
free
so
warm
Warm
in
the
hope
You
awaken
in
inside
me
Warm
love
to
guide
me
Like
a
star
from
afar
Warm
in
the
day
That
arises
to
greet
you
Warm
love
to
need
you
Wherever
you
are
