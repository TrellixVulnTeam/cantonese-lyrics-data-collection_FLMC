Once
upon
a
dream
When
this
world
ain't
what
it
seems
My
love
and
I
lived
inside
a
smile
The
time
was
nigh
We
broke
down
and
we
cried
Rcfriending
dragonflies
Lullabyes
and
funny
little
rides
We'd
spend
the
night
time
Counting
countless
stars
Choking
on
our
stolen
first
cigar.
There
is
no
reason
,
no
rhyme
No
need
of
keeping
track
of
time
A
life
just
passing
and
new
life
just
beginning

First
love
ensnared
my
mind
Wonderland
was
waiting
Butterflies
went
fluttering
by
We
wore
our
raincoats
standing
in
the
sun
One
by
one
Good
time
had
just
begun
Quite
lost
in
a
trance
My
love
and
I
lost
in
I
loving
dance
Turning
around
and
turning
again
Never
knowing
it
had
to
end
There
is
no
future
no
past
Your
first
love
won't
be
your
last
First
love
don't
last
oh
no
it
won't
last
But
it's
worthwhile
remembering
when
