Kick
It!
You
wake
up
late
for
school
man
you
don't
wanna
go,
You
ask
your
mom
'please?'
but
she
still
says
'NO!'
You
miss
two
classes
and
no
homework
but
your
teacher
preaches
class
like
you're
some
kind
of
jerk
You
gotta
fight,
for
your
right,
to
paaaaaaaaaarty
Your
pops
caught
you
smokin'
and
he
said
'NO
WAY!'
That
hypocrite
smokes
two
packs
a
day!

Man
living
at
home
is
such
a
drag
Now
your
mom
threw
away
your
best
porno
mag
You
gotta
fight,
for
your
right,
to
paaaaaaaaaarty
You
gotta
fight

MUSIC...
