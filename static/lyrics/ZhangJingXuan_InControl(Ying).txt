想到開心的時候
你說不會離開我
美麗的回憶就好像眼前的電影
但是你消失的那麼快
讓我怕都來不及
對你來說愛是不是很輕易
我知道你的脾氣
我愛你我不介意
我總是在想我錯在哪裡
Oh
Baby
我努力堅持不放棄
委屈都給我自己
死心塌地
為何你還是不珍惜
I
kown
I'm
really
in
love
with
you
I
care
and
I
really
don't
want
to
lose
you
I
do
what
I
promised
no
matter
how
hard
it
is
All
I
need
is
just
the
love
from
you
I
kown
I'm
really
in
love
with
you
I
care
and
I
really
don't
want
to
lose
you
I
never
hurt
you
baby
My
love
is
in
front
of
you
Cause
you
truly
hurt
my
heart
and
soul
