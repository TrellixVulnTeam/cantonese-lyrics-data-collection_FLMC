lightning
crashes,
a
new
mother
cries
her
placenta
falls
to
the
floor
the
angel
opens
her
eyes
the
confusion
sets
in
before
the
doctor
can
even
close
the
door
lightning
crashes,
an
old
mother
dies
her
intentions
fall
to
the
floor
the
angel
closes
her
eye
the
confusion
that
was
her
belongs
now
to
the
baby
down
the
hall
oh
now
feel
it
comin'
back
again
like
a
rollin'
thunder
chasing
the
wind
forces
pullin'
from
the
center
of
the
earth
again
I
can
feel
it.
lightning
crashes,

a
new
mother
cries
this
moment
she's
been
waiting
for
the
angel
open
her
eyes
pale
blue
colored
iris,
presents
the
circle
and
puts
the
glory
out
to
hide,
hide
oh
now
feel
it
comin'
back
again
like
a
rollin'
thunder
chasing
the
wind
forces
pullin'
from
the
center
of
the
earth
again
I
can
feel
it.
