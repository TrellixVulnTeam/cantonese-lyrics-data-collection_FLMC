Sometimes
the
love
thythms
that
fill
the
afternoon
Loose
all
their
meaning
with
the
rising
moon
Hold
me
and
tell
me
that
the
words
you
say
are
true
Answer
the
question
I
must
ask
of
you
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
I
guarantee
it
will
bring
you
down
If
you
try
and
fool
yourself
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
You
can
take
it
seriously
Or
take
it
somewhere
else
Take
all
the
freedom
that
a
lover
will
allow
If
you
feel
the
feeling
that
I'm
feeling
now
Where
love
goes
a
fool
knows
That
the
hurt
can
go
as
deep
Don't
make
a
promise
that
you
cannot
keep
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
I
guarantee
it
will
bring
you
down
If
you
try
and
fool
yourself
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
You
can
take
it
seriously

Or
take
it
somewhere
else
And
if
you
wanna
get
close
to
me
You
can
do
it
so
easily
Well
is
it
love
that
I
see
when
I
look
in
your
eyes
Or
just
another
empty
lie
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
I
guarantee
it
will
bring
you
down
If
you
try
and
fool
yourself
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
You
can
take
it
seriously
Or
take
it
somewhere
else
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
I
guarantee
it
will
bring
you
down
If
you
try
and
fool
yourself
Do
you
wanna
make
love
Or
do
you
just
wanna
fool
around
You
can
take
it
seriously
Or
take
it
somewhere
else
