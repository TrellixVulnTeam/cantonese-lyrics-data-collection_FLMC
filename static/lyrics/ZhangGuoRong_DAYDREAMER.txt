Lyrics：T.Dempsey
Music：T.Dempsey
I
remember
April
when
the
sun
was
in
th
sky
And
love
was
burning
in
your
eyes
Nothing
in
the
world
could
bother
me
Cause
I
was
living
in
the
world
of
made
believe
*I'm
just
a
daydreamer
walking
in
the
rain

Chasing
after
rainbows
I'm
in
never
fine
again
Life
is
much
too
beatiful
To
live
it
all
I
know
Oh
How
much
I
need
someone
to
go
my
very
own
I'm
just
a
daydreamer
Oh
Oh......
Ah
Ah......
