Lyrics：Manilow/Panzer
Music：Manilow/Panzer
When
there's
someone
else
who
cares
When
there's
someone
home
who's
waiting
just
for
me
Ever
now
I
think
about
you
as
I'm
climbing
up
the
stairs
And
I
wonder
what
to
do
so
she
won't
see
That
ever
now
When
I've
found
a
better
life
than
what
we
had
Ever
now
I
wake
up
crying
in
the
middle
of
the
night
And
I
can't
believe
it
still
could
hurt
so
bad
Ever
now
When
I
have
come
so
for
I
wonder
where
you
are
I
wonder
why
it's
still
so
hard
without
you
Ever
now
When
I
come
shining
through
I
swear
I
think
for
you
And
now
I
wish
you
know

Ever
now
Ever
now
When
I
never
hear
your
name
And
the
world
has
changed
so
much
since
you're
been
gone
Ever
now
I
still
remember
and
the
feeling's
still
the
same
And
this
pain
inside
of
me
goes
on
and
on
Ever
now
When
I
have
come
so
for
I
wonder
where
you
are
I
wonder
why
it's
still
so
hard
without
you
Ever
now
When
I
come
shining
through
I
swear
I
think
for
you
And
now
I
wish
you
know
Some
how
Ever
now
