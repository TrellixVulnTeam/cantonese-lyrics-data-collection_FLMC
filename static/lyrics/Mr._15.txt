PO
Another
morning
I
look
out
the
window
pane
Is
there
a
way
to
cure
this
pain?
Another
morning
I'm
staring
at
the
sun
again
And
everything,
everything
has
changed
Don't
let
yesterday
to
trip
you,
you
say
15
years
old
I'm
way
too
old
in
my
shoes
yeah
Yet
I
remember
what
you
said
and
done
that
turns
me
who
I
am
I'm
trying
hard
to
live
my
life
my
way

But
in
my
dreams
it
halts
me
again
Is
there
a
friend
who
knew
who
I
am
today
Do
you
remember
everything
I
said
15
years
old
I'm
way
too
old
in
my
shoes
yeah
Yet
I
remember
what
you
said
and
done
that
turns
me
who
I
am
15
years
old
am
I'm
way
too
old
in
my
shoes
yeah
Yet
I
remember
all
the
smiles
that
fade
away
15
years
old
am
I'm
way
too
old
in
my
shoes
yeah
Yet
I
remember
all
the
smiles
that
fade
away
today
