SPEAKS
AS
IT
LOVE
GRANDPA
SAID
TO
ME
IT'S
THE
VOICES
OF
OUR

BRINGING
JOY
TO
OUR
LIVES
THEY
MAKE
EVERYTHING
ALRIGHT
BUT
THEY'VE
GONE
AWAY
TOO
SOON
THE
ARE
RIDING
IN
THE
WIND.
*(I'M)STANDING
ON
A
MOUNTAIN
COUNTING
STARS
WITH
CHILDREN
HIGH
UP
IN
THE
SKY
AND
I
TELL
THEM,
ITS
THE
EYES
OUR
HEROES
SHINING
BRIGHT
FOR
YOU
TO
SEE
SO
THAT
YOU
CAN
BE
FREE
BUT
THEY'VE
GONE
AWAY
TOO
SOON

THE

RIDING
IN
THE
WIND.

THE
HEARTS
OF
YOU
AND
I
THEY

BLESSING
OUR
CHILDREN

BLESSING
OUR
NATION

REMEMBER
THEM
AS
HEROES
WHOSE
SPIRITS
TOUCHED
AND
BRIGHTEN
UP
OUR
LIFES
Repeat
*#
(THEY'RE)
USING
THE
POWER
OF
LOVE
TO
MAKE
THE
WORLD
A
BETTER
PLACE
FOR
YOU
AND
ME

WE'RE
HAPPY
AND

UP
OUR
