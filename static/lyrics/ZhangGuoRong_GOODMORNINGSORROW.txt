Akira
I
wake
up
with
the
sun
in
the
morning
And
once
again
I
find
you're
with
me
and
I
know
You're
the
only
one
who
can
help
to
wake
it
easy
So
here
we
are,
you
and
I,
good
morning
sorrow
Just
like
before
I
lean
on
you
You're
the
one
friend
who's
true
Who
needs
answers
when
there's
nothing
left
to
say
Why
should
I
hear
it
all
again
How
times
easies
pain
When
nothing
can
bring
back
yesterday

I
wake
up
with
the
sun
in
the
morning
Leave
the
phone
off
the
hook
so
I'm
busy
all
day
long
The
coffee's
growing
cold
my
books
lie
unopened
Here
we
are
once
again
good
morning
sorrow
*Just
like
before
I
lean
on
you
My
friend
you
never
knew
What
if
feels
like
to
be
in
love
this
way
Maybe
the
years
will
heal
the
pain
Maybe
I'll
even
love
again
But
nothing
can
bring
back
yesterday
