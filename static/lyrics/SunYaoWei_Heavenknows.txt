Lyrics：The
Corrs
Music：The
Corrs
She's
always
on
my
mind.
From
the
time
I
wake
up
untill
I
close
my
eyes.
She's
everywhere
I
go.
She's
all
I
know.
Ans
though
she's
so
far
away.
It
just
keeps
getting
stronger
every
day.
And
even
now
she's
gone.
I'm
still
holding
on.
So
tell
me
where
do
I
start.
Because
it's
breaking
my
heart.
Don't
wanna
let
her
go.
Maybe
my
love
will
come
back
some
day.
Only
heaven
knows.
And
maybe
our
hearts
will
find
a
way.
Only
heaven
knows.
Ans
all
I
can
do
is
hope
and
pray.
Because
heaven
knows.
My
friends
keep
telling
me.

That
if
you
really
love
her.
You've
gotta
set
her
free.
And
if
she
returms
in
kind.
I'll
know
she's
mine.
So
tell
me
where
do
I
start.
Because
it's
breaking
my
heart.
Don't
wanna
let
her
go.
Why
I
live
in
despair.
Because
wide
awake
or
dreaming.
I
know
she's
never
there.
And
all
the
time
I
act
so
brave
I'm
shaking
inside.
Why
does
it
hurt
me
so.
Maybe
my
love
will
come
back
some
day.
Only
heaven
knows.
And
maybe
our
hearts
will
find
a
way.
Only
Heaven
knows.
And
all
I
can
do
is
hope
and
pray.
Because
heaven
knows
