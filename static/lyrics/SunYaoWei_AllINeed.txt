Kissin'
you
was
not
what
i
had
planed
and
now
I'm
not
so
sure
just
where
i
stand
i
wasn't
looking
for
true
love
but
now
you're
looking
at
me
you're
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
you're
the
only
one
i
see
all
i
need
,is
just
a
little
more
time
to
be
sure,what
i
feel
is
it
all
in
my
mind
cuz
it
seems
so
hard
to
believe
that
you're
all
I
need
i
guess
it's
true
we've
all
been
hurt
before
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
matther
anymore

it
may
be
a
chance
we're
taking
but
it
always
comes
to
this
if
this
isn't
love
we're
making
and
i
don't
know
what
it
is
no
stars
are
out
tonight
but
we're
shining
our
own
light
and
it's
never
felt
so
right
cuz
girl
the
way
i'm
feeling
it'S
easy
to
believe
that
you're
all
I
need
oh
you're
all
I
need
ah...
