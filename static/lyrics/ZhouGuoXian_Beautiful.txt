Beautiful,
you're
beautiful,
as
beautiful
as
the
sun
Wonderful,
you're
wonderful,
as
wonderful
as
they
come
And
I
can't
help
but
feel
attached
To
the
feelings
I
can't
even
match
With
my
face
pressed
up
to
the
glass,
wanting
you
Beautiful,
you're
beautiful,
as
beautiful
as
the
sky
Wonderful,
it's
wonderful,
to
know
that
you're
just
like
I
And
I'm
sure
you
know
me
well,
as
I'm
sure
you
don't
But
you
just
can't
tell,
who'll
you
love
and
who
you
won't
who'll
you
love
and
who
you
won't
I
love
you,
as
you
love
me
So
let
the
clouds
roll
by
your
face
We'll
let
the
world
spin
on
to
another
place

We'll
climb
the
tallest
tree
above
it
all
To
look
down
on
you
and
me
and
them
And
I'm
sure
you
know
me
well,
as
I'm
sure
you
don't
But
you
just
can't
tell,
who
you'll
love
and
who
you
won't
who
you'll
love
and
who
you
won't
who
you'll
love
and
who
you
won't
Don't
let
your
life
wrap
up
around
you
Don't
forget
to
call,
whenever
I'll
be
here
just
waiting
for
you
I'll
be
under
your
stars
forever
Neither
here
nor
there
just
right
beside
you
I'll
be
under
the
stairs
forever
Neither
here
nor
there
just
right
beside
you
Don't
forget
to
call,
whenever
I'll
be
here
just
waiting
for
you
I'll
be
under
your
stars
forever
Neither
here
nor
there
just
right
beside
you
I'll
be
under
the
stairs
forever
Neither
here
nor
there
just
right
beside
you
Don't
forget
to
call,
whenever
I'll
be
here
just
waiting
for
you
