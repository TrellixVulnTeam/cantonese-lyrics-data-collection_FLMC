'Tis
the
season
now
For
gifts
and
giving
all
The
love
our
hearts
And
dreams
can
afford
And
when
I
think
about
you
The
hope
that
you've
handed
out
I
want
to
give
back
all
I
have
And
then
some
more
But
I'm
only
human
I
can
only
do
so
much
But
all
the
miracles
we
need
Is
just
one
touch,just
one
touch
(Chorus)
From
me
from
you
Helping
someone
who
can't
make
it
on
their
own

No
one
wants
to
be
alone
at
a
time
like
this
Only
joy
should
exist
When
the
world
gets
too
much
All
we
need,
all
we
need
is
a
touch
of
love
When
hard
times
appear
When
we
drown
in
our
tears
There's
faith
enough
to
see
us
through
Whatever
rains
on
us
We
can
always
trust
That
heaven's
hand
will
guide
us
through
Yeah
we're
only
human
But
we
can
all
do
so
much
All
the
miracles
we
need
Is
just
one
touch
Yeah
just
one
touch
(Chorus)
It
took
a
child
t
touch
the
world
Just
think
what
we
can
do
Think
of
the
miracles
