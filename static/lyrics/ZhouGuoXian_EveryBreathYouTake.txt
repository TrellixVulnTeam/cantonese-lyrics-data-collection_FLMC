Every
breath
you
take
Every
move
you
make
Every
bond
you
break
Every
step
you
take
I'll
be
watching
you
Every
single
day
Every
word
you
say
Every
game
you
play
Every
night
you
stay
I'll
be
watching
you
Oh,
can't
you
see
you
belong
to
me
How
my
poor
heartaches
with
every
step
you
take
Every
move
you
make
Every
vow
you
break
Every
smile
you
fake

Every
claim
you
stake
I'll
be
watching
you
Since
you've
gone
I've
been
lost
without
a
trace
I
dream
at
night,
I
can
only
see
your
face
I
look
around,
but
it's
you
I
can't
replace
I
feel
so
cold,
and
I
long
for
your
embrace
I
keep
it
call
baby,
baby
please
Oh,
can't
you
see
you
belong
to
me
How
my
poor
heartaches
with
every
step
you
take
Every
move
you
make
Every
vow
you
break
Every
smile
you
fake
Every
claim
you
stake
I'll
be
watching
you
Every
move
you
make
Every
step
you
take
I'll
be
watching
you...
