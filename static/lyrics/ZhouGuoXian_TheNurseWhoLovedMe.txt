Say
hello
to
the
rug's
topography
It
holds
quite
a
lot
of
interest
with
your
face
down
on
it
Say
hello
to
the
shrinking
in
your
head
You
can't
see
it
but
you
know
its
there
so
don't
neglect
it
I'm
taking
her
home
with
me
all
dressed
in
white
She's
got
everything
I
need
pharmacy
keys
She's
falling
hard
for
me
I
can
see
it
in
her
eyes
She
acts
just
like
a
nurse
with
all
the
other
guys
Say
hello
to
all
the
apples
on
the
ground

They
were
once
in
your
eyes
but
you
sneezed
them
out
while
sleeping
Say
hello
to
everything
you've
left
behind
It's
even
more
a
part
of
your
life
now
that
you
can't
touch
it
I'm
taking
her
home
with
me
all
dressed
in
white
She's
got
everything
I
need
some
pills
in
a
little
cup
She's
falling
hard
for
me
I
can
see
it
in
her
eyes
She
acts
just
like
a
nurse
with
all
the
other
guys
She's
got
everything
I
need
pharmacy
keys
She
acts
just
like
a
nurse
with
all
the
other
guys
Say
hello
to
the
rug's
topography
