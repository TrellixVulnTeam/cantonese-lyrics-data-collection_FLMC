Lyrics：R.Edelman
Music：R.Edelman
I
heard
the
music
coming
fainly
thro
the
wall
of
an
old
cafe
I
was
fellin'
kinda
restless
and
drifted
t'wars
the
noise
It
was
the
end
of
the
day
Thro
the
down,
down
the
hall
the
sound
I
heard
thro
the
wall
was
getting
near
So
I
grabbed
a
sent
and
ordered
a
drink
And
was
surpised
that
they
was
play'in
my
favourite
thing
They
were
singing
that
old
unforgetable
pistol
packin'
melody
It's
a
true
that
set
me
singing

and
the
rhythm
they
were
playing
Justa
made
me
want
to
live
They
were
singing
that
old
unforgetable
pistol
packin'
melody
And
it
tingles
up
a
feelin'
and
sets
my
heart
a
feelin'
and
it
mades
me
want
to
live
And
run
home
and
write
the
same
kinda
thing
on
my
own
They
were
singing
that
old
unforgetable
pistol
packin'
melody
