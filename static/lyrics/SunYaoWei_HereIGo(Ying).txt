Here
I
go
again
Sometimes
when
I'm
all
alone
I
get
to
thinking
Ten
minutes
between
blinking
Starring
off
into
nothing
But
yo
there's
a
lot
on
my
mind
I
start
to
wonder
where
my
life
is
taking
me
Am
I
stuck
in
the
matrix
Or
did
heaven
design
this
Did
I
do
what
I
was
supposed
to
do
yesterday
Or
is
tomorrow
gonna
be
a
replay
of
what
I
did
already
I
don't
know
what
to
do
I
can't
tell
where
to
turn
Blinded
by
the
fog
of
fear
Gotta
leave
here
Here
I
go,
I
go
Here
I
go,
I
go
Taking
things
I
ain't
got
no
business
taking
Feels
like
the
ground
shaking
But
it
ain't
Shivering
from
the
pain
Hoping
that
this
love
takes
me
where
I
wanna
go

Then
I
realize
that
we
broke
up
a
day
ago
I
can't
get
hold
a
grip
Too
wise
just
to
slip
Gotta
loosen
up
the
reigns
Or
let
go
of
it
I
can't
help
but
wonder
if
my
mind
is
playing
tricks
Should
I
reevaluate
my
life
or
be
in
love
with
it
Here
I
go,
I
go,
I
go
Here
I
go
again
Here
I
go,
I
go
Here
I
go
again
I
wish
that
everything
that
passed
by
in
a
flash
be
visible
Maybe
then
I
could
explain
why
it
never
lasts
be
sensible
If
it
all
were
to
slow
down
I
would
never
see
the
things
that
were
meant
to
go
slow
So
here
I
go
Here
I
go
again
Thinking
about
things
that
don't
matter
Irrelevant
chatter
seems
to
me
to
be
the
cause
for
lack
of
laughter
Here
I
go
Here
I
go
again
Hoping
that
this
love
takes
me
where
I
wanna
go
Then
I
realize
that
we
broke
up
a
day
ago
