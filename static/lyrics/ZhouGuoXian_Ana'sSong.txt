Please
die,
Ana
For
as
long
as
you're
here,
we're
not
You
make
the
sound
of
laughter
And
sharpened
nails
seem
softer
And
I
need
you
now,
somehow
And
I
need
you
now,
somehow
Open
fire
On
the
needs
designed
On
my
knees
for
you
Open
fire
On
my
knees
desires
What
I
need
from
you
Imagine
pageant
In
my
head
The
flesh
seems
thicker
Sandpaper
tears
corrode
the
film
And
I
need
you
now,
somehow
And
I
need
you
now,
somehow
Open
fire
On
the
needs
designed
On
my
knees
for
you

Open
fire
On
my
knees
desires
What
I
need
from
you
And
you're
my
obsession
I
love
you
to
the
bones
And
Ana
wrecks
your
life
Like
an
anorexia
life
Open
fire
On
the
needs
designed
On
my
knees
for
you
Open
fire
On
the
needs
designed
On
my
knees
for
you
Open
fire
On
my
knees
desires
What
I
need
from
you
Open
fire
On
the
needs
designed
Open
fire
On
my
knees
desires
On
my
knees
On
my
knees
for
you
