Oh
It's
time
to
dream
a
thousand
dreams
of
you
It's
been
so
grand
together
yes
together
You
thrilled
me
from
the
start
You
brought
the
Spring
again
Your
fingers
touched
the
strings
of
my
heart
and
made
it
sing
again

＊I
hope
you
dream
a
thousand
dreams
of
me
All
things
we've
planned
doing
together
(Well
we
promise
to
do
something
together)

And
if
you
do
I
dream
my
whole
life
through
A
thousand
a
million
a
zillion
dreams
of
you＊
REPEAT＊
