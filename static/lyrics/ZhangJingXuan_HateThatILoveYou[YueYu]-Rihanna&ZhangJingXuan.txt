R：So
how
much
I
love
you
(H：Yeah)

So
how
much
I
need
you
(H：Yeah
Yeah
Yeah)
R：And
I
can't
stand
ya

Must
everything
you
do

Make
me
wanna
smile

Can
I
not
like
it
for
awhile
No
H：為我設想

別叫我歡暢
可惜親吻你

忘掉在溫馨中帶涼

視你如偶像
忘掉這麼想最傷

But
I
hate
it
R：You
know
exactly
what
to
do

So
that
I
can't
stay
mad
at
you

For
too
long

That's
wrong
H：Girl
I
hate
it

事實是你一刻技癢

便自動勾起我幻想
消失智商

自問我討厭這份遐想
R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy

I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
need
you)

R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy

But
I
just
can't
let
you
go

And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
H：實在你也知道

我開心因見到


平和地相處的美好
R：Sad
and
it's
not
fair

How
you
take
advantage
of
the
fact
that

I
love
you
beyond
the
reason
why

And
it
just
ain't
right
H：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl

我未能拋得開痛著醉倒

And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl

無法遺失的擁抱

But
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
R：One
of
these
days
maybe
your
magic
won't
affect
me

And
your
kiss
won't
make
me
weak
H：最恨世上
講相知

得你能透視至此

大概這點心意
像咒語玩意

Hate
that
I
love
you
so
R：So
much
I
love
you
H：How
much
I
need
you
R：So
much
I
need
you
H：How
much
I
love
you
R：So
much
I
love
you
(H:
I
need
you)

So
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
need
you)
R：And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
(R+H:
So)
H：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
girl
(R:
Hey)
R：I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you
(H:
I
can't
stand
how
much
I
need
you)
R：And
I
hate
how
much
I
love
you
boy
(H:
Yeah
Oh)

But
I
just
can't
let
you
go
(H:
But
I
just
can't
let
go
No)
R+H：And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
And
I
hate
that
I
love
you
so
so
