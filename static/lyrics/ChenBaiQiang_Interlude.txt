Time
is
like
a
dream
And
now
for
a
time
you
are
mine
Let's
hold
fast
to
the
dream
That
tastes
and
sparkles
like
wine
Who
knows
if
it's
real
or
just
something
We're
both
dreaming
of
What
seem
like
an
interlude
now
Could
be
the
beginning
of
love

Loving
you
is
a
world
that's
strange
So
much
more
than
my
heart
can
hold
Loving
you
make
the
whole
world
change
Loving
you
I
could
not
grow
old
No,
nobody
knows
when
love
will
end
So
till
then
sweet
friend
(Time
is
like
a
dream)
(And
now
for
a
time
you
are
mine)
(Let's
hold
fast
to
the
dream)
(That
tastes
and
sparkles
like
wine)
