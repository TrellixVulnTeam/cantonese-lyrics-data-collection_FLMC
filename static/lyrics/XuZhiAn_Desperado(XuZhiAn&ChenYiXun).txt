desperado,
why
don't
you
come
to
your
senses?
you
been
out
ridin'
fences
for
so
long
now
oh,
you're
a
hard
one
i
know
that
you
got
your
reasons
these
things
that
are
pleasin'
you
can
hurt
you
somehow
don'
you
draw
the
queen
of
diamonds,
boy
she'll
beat
you
if
she's
able
you
know
the
queen
of
heats
is
always
your
best
bet
now
it
seems
to
me,
some
fine
things
have
been
laid
upon
your
table
but
you
only
want
the
ones
that
you
can't
get
desperado,
oh,
you
ain't
gettin'
no
youger
your
pain
and
your
hunger,
they're
drivin'
you
home

and
freedom,
oh
freedom
well,
that's
just
some
people
talkin'
your
prison
is
walking
through
this
world
all
alone
don't
your
feet
get
cold
in
the
winter
time?
the
sky
won't
snow
and
the
sun
won't
shine
it's
hard
to
tell
the
night
time
from
the
day
you're
loosin'
all
your
highs
and
lows
ain't
it
funny
how
the
feeling
goes
away?
desperado,
why
don't
you
come
to
your
senses?
come
down
from
your
fences,
open
the
gate
it
may
be
rainin',
but
there's
a
rainbow
above
you
you
better
let
somebody
love
you,
before
it's
too
late
you
better
let
somebody
love
you,
before
it's
too
late
