(男)You've
given
me
a
way
to
see
How
Perfect
Life
Can
be
(女)You've
given
me
the
master
key
That
really
sets
me
free
(男)And
If
It's
Taken
Me
some
time
To
Realize
that
you
are
mine
(女)At
last
I'm
yours
And
life's
so
fine
(合)so
finally
(女)I
Can't
Believe
You've
given
me
A
Love
so
warm
and
true
(男)And
I
can't
remember
wanting
more
Now
I
have
you
(女)Now
I
know
for
sure
It's
time
To
leave
the
darkest
days
behind
(男)'Cos
you're
mine
and
life's
so
fine
(合)so
finally
(男)From
now
on
you
will
stay
forever
In
my
heart
(女)From
now
on
You'll
be
with
me
though
we
are
apart
(合)From
now
on
I
somehow
just
know

I'll
never
let
you
go
away
from
me
from
now
on
(男)You've
shown
the
way
for
me
to
stay
I'll
love
till
the
end
(女)Into
beyond
when
life
has
gone
I'll
still
love
if
I
can
(男)I
Know
It's
taking
me
some
time
To
find
the
one
I've
had
to
find
(女)
At
last
I'm
yours
And
life's
so
fine
(合)so
finally
(男)From
now
on
you'll
stay
forever
in
my
heart
(女)From
now
on
You'll
be
with
me
though
we
are
apart
(合)From
now
on
I
somehow
just
know
I'll
never
let
you
go
away
from
me
From
now
on
at
least
I'm
yours
and
life's
so
fine
So
finally
(男)from
now
on
you'll
stay
forever
in
my
heart
(女)From
now
on
You'll
be
with
me
though
we
are
apart
(合)From
now
on
I
somehow
just
know
I'll
never
let
you
go
away
from
me
from
now
on
I
somehow
just
know
I'll
never
let
you
go
Away
from
me
from
now
on
