How
long,
how
long
will
I
slide
Separate
my
side
I
don't
I
don't
believe
it's
bad
Slittin'
my
throat
It's
all
I
ever
I
heard
your
voice
through
a
photograph
I
thought
it
up
it
brought
up
the
past
Once
you
know
you
can
never
go
back
I've
got
to
take
it
on
the
otherside
Centuries
are
what
it
meant
to
me
A
cemetery
where
I
married
the
sea
Stranger
things
could
never
change
my
mind
I've
got
to
take
it
on
the
otherside
Take
it
on
the
otherside
Take
it
on
Take
it
on
How
long,
how
long
will
I
slide
Separate
my
side
I
don't
I
don't
believe
it's
bad
Slittin'
my
throat
It's
all
I
ever
Pour
my
life
into
a
paper
cup
The
ashtray's
full
and
I'm
spillin'
my
guts
She
wants
to
know
am
I
still
a
slut
I've
got
to
take
it
on
the
otherside

Scarlet
starlet
and
she's
in
my
bed
A
candidate
for
my
soul
mate
bled
Push
the
trigger
and
pull
the
thread
I've
got
to
take
it
on
the
otherside
Take
it
on
the
otherside
Take
it
on
Take
it
on
How
long,
how
long
will
I
slide
Separate
my
side
I
don't
I
don't
believe
it's
bad
Slittin'
my
throat
It's
all
I
ever
Turn
me
on,
take
me
for
a
hard
ride
Burn
me
out,
leave
me
on
the
otherside
I
yell
and
tell
it
that
It's
not
my
friend
I
tear
it
down
I
tear
it
down
And
then
it's
born
again
How
long,
how
long
will
I
slide
Separate
my
side
I
don't
I
don't
believe
it's
bad
Slittin'
my
throat
It's
all
I
ever
I
don't
I
don't
believe
it's
bad
Slittin'
my
throat
It's
all
I
ever
