Lyrics：B.Scaggs
Music：B.Scaggs
Outside
the
rain
begins,
and
it
may
never
end
So
cry
no
more,
on
the
shore
a
dream
Will
take
us
out
to
sea
Forever
more,
forever
more
Close
your
eyes
and
dream,
and
you
can
be
with
me
Neath
the
waves,
through
the
caves
of
hours
Long
forgotten
now
We're
all
alone,
We're
all
alone
Close
the
window
calm
the
light
And
it
will
be
alright
No
need
to
bother
now
Let
it
out,
let
it
all
begin
Learn
how
to
pretend
Once
a
story's
told
it
can't
help
but
grow
old
Roses
do,
lovers
too,
so
cast
your
seasons
to
the
wind

And
told
me
dear,
Ohhh
hold
me
Dear
Close
the
window
calm
the
light
And
ir
will
be
all
alright
No
need
to
bother
now
Let
it
out,
let
it
all
begin
All's
forgotten
now
We're
all
alone,
all
alone
Close
the
window
calm
the
light
And
ir
will
be
all
alright
No
need
to
bother
now
Let
it
out,
let
it
all
begin
Owe
it
to
the
wind
My
love
Hold
me
Dear
All's
forgotten
now
my
love
We're
all
alone
