MusicWell
this
Christmas,I
am
falling
like
snowflakes
at
your
doorAs
my
guardian
angel
singing
for
someone
elseEternity
stings,
when
love
has
turned
into
painWoo
'love'
must
be
something
I
don't
deserveThis
is
my
private
Christmas
SongAll
the
memories
are
fading
Snow
turns
to
rainAs
tonight,
I
am
craving
for
those
endless
kissesA
melody
written
for
someonejust
as
a
child
has
its
parentsThis
song
is
something
you
never
care
forWell
This
is
My
Private
Christmas
songThis
is
My
Private
Christmas
Song
