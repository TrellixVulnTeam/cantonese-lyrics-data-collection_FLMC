Well
this
Christmas,
I
am
falling
like
snowflakes
at
your
door
As
my
guardian
angel
singing
for
someone
else
Eternity
stings,
when
love
has
turned
into
pain
Woo
'love'
must
be
something
I
don't
deserve
This
is
my
private
Christmas
Song

All
the
memories
are
fading
Snow
turns
to
rain
As
tonight,
I
am
craving
for
those
endless
kisses
A
melody
written
for
someone
just
as
a
child
has
its
parents
This
song
is
something
you
never
care
for
Well
This
is
My
Private
Christmas
song
This
is
My
Private
Christmas
Song
