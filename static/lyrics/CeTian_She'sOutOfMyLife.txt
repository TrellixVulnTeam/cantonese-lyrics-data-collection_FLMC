She's
Out
Of
My
Life
She's
Out
Of
My
Life
And
I
Don't
Know
Whether
To
Laugh
Or
Cry
I
Don't
Know
Whether
To
Live
Or
Die
And
It
Cuts
Like
A
Knife
She's
Out
Of
My
Life
It's
Out
Of
My
Hands
It's
Out
Of
My
Hands
To
Think
For
Three
Years
She
Was
Here
And
I
Took
Her
For
Granted
I
Was
So
Cavalier

Now
The
Way
That
It
Stands
She's
Out
Of
My
Hands
So
I've
Learned
That
Love's
Not
Possession
And
I've
Learned
That
Love
Won't
Wait
Now
I've
Learned
Love
Needs
Expression
But
I
Learned
Too
Late
She's
Out
Of
My
Life
Damned
Indecision
And
Cursed
Pride
Kept
My
Love
For
Her
Locked
Deep
Inside
And
It
Cuts
Like
A
Knife
She's
Out
Of
My
Life
