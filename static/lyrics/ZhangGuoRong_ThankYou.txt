There's
a
peaceful
easy
feeling
Blowing
softly
thru
the
trees
Which
welcomes
in
the
morning
light
That
shines
for
me
to
see
And
it
takes
me
past
my
sorrow
And
keeps
me
from
the
rain
For
all
these
things
I'd
like
to
Thank
you
once
again
There's
a
stairway
in
the
mountains
And
it
leads
up
to
the
stars
And
stars
can
move
the
clouds
away
And
keep
me
from
the
dark
And
when
I
feel
alone
and
lost
They'll
show
me
the
way
For
all
these
things
I'd
like
to
thank
you
once
again
Thank
you
for
the
love
That's
right
here
in
this
song
Thank
you
for
my
dreams
For
everything
Life
has
given
me
We
seldom
stop
to
think
that
We
have
travelled
very
far

Seen
and
heard
a
million
things
Even
wished
upon
a
star
Cared
for
all
the
close
friends
Who
have
passed
along
the
way
For
all
these
things
and
more
Thank
you
once
again
Thank
you
for
the
love
That's
right
here
in
this
song
Thank
you
for
my
dreams
For
everything
Life
has
given
me
Thank
you
for
the
love
That's
right
here
in
this
song
Thank
you
for
my
dreams
For
everything
Life
has
given
me
Thank
you
for
the
love
That's
right
here
in
this
song
Thank
you
for
my
dreams
For
everything
Life
has
given
me
Thank
you
for
the
love
That's
right
here
in
this
song
Thank
you
for
my
dreams
For
everything
Life
has
given
me
