For
you
I
sing
this
lullaby
Make
sure
that
baby
you
sleep
tight
Oh
baby
never
say
good
night
Cuz
i
will
see
you
in
my
dream
Easy
as
it
seems
Why
don't
you
count
your
sheep
along
with
me
baby
123.
如用我腦海去親你
只感到越愛越好奇
能用我歌聲去親你
Dream
away
Baby
baby
close
your
eyes
Only
thing
that's
left
to
say
Dream
away
Dream
away
Dream
away
Dream
away
