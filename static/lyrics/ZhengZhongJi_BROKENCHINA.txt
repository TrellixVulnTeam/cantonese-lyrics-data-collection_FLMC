LOVE
IS
SUCH
A
FRAGILE
THING
REAR
AND
FINE
AS
PORCALAIN
IT
CAN
BREAK
SO
EASILY
BUT
IT'S
HARD
TO
MEND
WE
DIDN'T
HOLD
ON
TIGHT
ENOUGH
WHEN
LINES
WERE
CROSSED
WE
LOST
OUR
TRUST
IT'S
LIKE
WE
LET
A
PRECIOUS
CUP
FALL
FROM
OUR
HANDS
WE
CAN
PICK
UP
THE
PIECES
ONE
BY
ONE
TRY
TO
UNDO
THE
DAMAGE
DONE
AND
HOPE
THAT
THINGS
WILL
ONE
DAY
BE
THE
SAME

WE
CAN
GLUE
US
TOGETHER
BIT
BY
BIT
AND
MAKE
THE
JAGGED
EDGES
FIT
BUT
THE
SCARS
WILL
BE
LIKE
CRACKS
THAT
REMAIN
ON
BROKEN
CHINA
UNDER
COVER
OF
THE
DARK
WE
LIE
IN
EACHOTHERS
ARMS
AND
FOR
A
MOMENT
NOTHING'S
WRONG
AND
WE'RE
OKAY
BUT
WHEN
MORNING
COMES
THE
SUN
REVEALS
THERE
ARE
WOUNDS
THAT
HAVEN'T
HEALED
WE
REALIZE
THEY
NEVER
WILL
BUT
STILL
WE
PRAY
ON
BROKEN
CHINA
