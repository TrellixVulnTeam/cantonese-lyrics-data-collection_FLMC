電影'2002'主題曲
Lyrics：Steven
Music：謝霆鋒
Arranger：馮德倫
Are
we
at
war
tonight
Will
there
be
angels
whispering
to
me
Goodnight
Don't
wake
when
the
lightning
strikes
My
heart
for
you
is
true
Let
no
one
take
that
from
you
Time
is
running
tight
Can't
change
from
wrong
to
right
So,
I'll
close
my
eyes
and
dream
a
little
Just
like
how
we
used
to
be,
Baby
It's
time
to
say
farewell
No
need
to
cry
or
feeling
sorrow
It's
alright
,
all
in
the
book
of
life
Heaven
grant
me
one
last
wish
I
beg
you
Let
me
say
these
words
before
I
go
I
will
love
you
till
the
end
of
time
With
every
breath
of
mine,
I'll
hold
you
by
my
side
But
I'll
rest
in
peace
My
sweet
heart
would
you
let
me
die
in
your
arms
with
you
Only
you
can
stop
the
rain
tonight
Only
you
can
change
my
world
from
black
to
white
So,
I'll
close
my
eyes
and
dream
a
little
more

Are
we
at
war
tonight
Will
there
be
angels
whispering
to
me
goodnight
Don't
wake
when
the
lightning
strikes
Heaven
grant
me
one
last
wish
i
beg
you
Let
me
say
these
words
before
I
go
I
will
love
you
till
the
end
of
time
With
every
breath
of
mine,
I'll
hold
you
by
my
side
But
I'll
rest
in
peace
My
sweet
heart
would
you
let
me
die
in
your
arms
with
you
Only
you
can
stop
the
rain
tonight
Only
you
can
give
me
strength
to
fight
Till
the
sky
is
burning
,
it's
the
end
of
time
Look
ahead
tomorrow,
a
long
and
winding
road
Keep
the
faith
of
mine,
don't
let
it
go
You're
the
only
reason,
night
ain't
growing
cold
What
will
I
do,
without
you
I
will
love
you
till
the
end
of
time
With
every
breath
of
mine,
I'll
hold
you
by
my
side
But
I'll
rest
in
peace
My
sweet
heart
would
you
let
me
die
in
your
arms
with
you
Only
you
can
stop
the
rain
tonight
Only
you
can
make
my
world
so
bright,life,
no
longer
empty,
With
you
in
my
heart,
in
my
heart
