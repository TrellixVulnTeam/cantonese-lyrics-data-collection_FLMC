Lyrics：B.Gosh
Music：B.Gosh
When
you
body's
had
enough
of
me
and
I'm
laying
flat
out
on
the
floor
When
you
think
I've
loved
you
all
I
can
I'm
golla
love
you
a
little
bit
more
Come
on
over
and
lay
by
my
side
I've
got
to
be
touching
you
Let
me
rub
your
tired
shoulders
The
way
I
used
to
do
Look
in
to
my
eyes,
and
gives
me
that
smile
The
ont
that
always
turns
me
on

And
let
me
take
your
hair
down
'cuase
we're
standing
up
to
great
the
sun
Got
to
say
a
few
things,
that
have
been
in
my
mind
And
you
know
where
my
mind
has
been
I
guess
I
learned
my
lessons
And
now's
the
time
to
begin
So
if
you're
feeling
alright
and
you're
ready
for
me
I
know
that
I'm
ready
for
you
We'd
better
get
it
on
now
'cause
we
got
to
a
whole
life
to
live
through
