Lyrics：謝霆鋒Music：謝霆鋒Arranger：劉志遠I
go
bling
When
I
look
straight
into
thesun
I
go
deaf
when
I
hear
thunders
onthe
run
But
when
I
see
you
sleeping
herebeside
me.Life's
just
begun
I
can
tell
itto
the
whole
world.
You're
the
one
Isee
your
shadow
cast
on
the
wall
When
thesun
shines
I
hear
you
callingthrough
the
window
when
it
rainsI
tend
to
tremble
when
I
start
to
think
ofjust
you
andl
I
don't
know
why.There's
no
replyIt
doesn't
matter
what
happens
tothe
weather,
I'm
shivering
when
I'mstanding
alone.
A
stom
is
torming
deepinside
me.A
hurricane
has
got
a
life
of
it's
own.It
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
the
weather,Without
you
I'm
just
falling
apart.The
snow
is
freezing
all
my
senses,When
hail
falls
down,Then
it's
already
too
late
for
heartbreak
