I
go
bling
When
I
look
straight
into
the
sun
I
go
deaf
when
I
hear
thunders
on
the
run
But
when
I
see
you
sleeping
here
beside
me.
Life's
just
begun
I
can
tell
it
to
the
whole
world.
You're
the
one
I
see
your
shadow
cast
on
the
wall
When
the
sun
shines
I
hear
you
calling
through
the
window
when
it
rains
I
tend
to
tremble
when
I
start
to
think
of

just
you
andl
I
don't
know
why.
There's
no
reply
It
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
the
weather,
I'm
shivering
when
I'm
standing
alone.
A
stom
is
torming
deep
inside
me.
A
hurricane
has
got
a
life
of
it's
own.
It
doesn't
matter
what
happens
to
the
weather,
Without
you
I'm
just
falling
apart.
The
snow
is
freezing
all
my
senses,
When
hail
falls
down,
Then
it's
already
too
late
for
heartbreak
