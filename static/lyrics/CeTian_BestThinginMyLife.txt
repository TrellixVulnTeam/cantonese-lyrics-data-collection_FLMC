(On
Your
Mark)
In
times
of
loneliness
when
I
feel
like
giving
everything
I
own
in
my
life
in
exchange
for
a
moment
or
two
just
having
you
by
my
side
in
times
of
desperation
when
all
I
could
do
is
holding
on
to
what's
left
of
you
just
the
thought
of
you
will
always
be
true
you're
the
best
thing
in
my
life
they
say
that
love
comes
easy
as
the
love
that
goes
with
the
hours
of
the
night
well
our
mornings
were
always
filled
with
loving
still
in
our
eyes
you
see
I'm
lost
I'm
hopelessly
lost
inside
my
mind
all
because
of
you
just
the
thought
of
you
will
always
be
true
you're
the
best
thing
in
my
life

and
when
the
morning
comes
and
the
sun
refuses
to
rise
and
the
night
goes
on
without
a
star
in
the
sky
I'll
still
be
missing
you
til
the
very
day
that
I
die
taking
with
me
all
the
pain
and
misery
forgotten
songs
and
memories
of
you
if
you
could
see
me
and
hear
the
words
I
wanted
to
say
with
you
I
lived
a
lifetime
without
you
can't
face
another
day
if
I
could
see
you
if
only
I
could
tell
you
just
how
much
I
really
love
you
just
the
thought
of
you
will
always
be
true
you're
the
best
thing
in
my
life
you're
the
best
thing
ever
the
very
best
in
my
life
