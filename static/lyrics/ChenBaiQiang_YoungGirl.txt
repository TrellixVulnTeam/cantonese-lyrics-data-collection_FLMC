Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
With
all
the
charms
of
a
woman
You've
kept
the
secret
of
your
youth
You
led
me
to
believe
You're
old
enough
to
give
me
love
And
now
it
hurts
to
know
the
truth
Oh……
Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
Beneath
your
perfume
and
make
up
You're
just
a
baby
in
disguise
And
tho's
you
know
that
is
wrong
to
be
along
with
me
That
come
on
look
is
in
your
eyes

Oh……
Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
So
hurry
home
to
you
mamma
I'm
sure
she
wonders
where
you
are
Get
out
of
here
before
I
have
the
time
change
my
mind
Cause
I'm
afraid
we'll
go
too
long
Oh……
Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
Young
girl
,
get
out
of
my
mind
My
love
for
you
is
way
out
of
line
Better
run
girl
,
you're
much
too
young
girl
