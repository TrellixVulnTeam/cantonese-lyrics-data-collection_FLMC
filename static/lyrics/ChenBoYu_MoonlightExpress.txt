I,
look
at
the
moon
I
see
my
crime
Thinking
of
you
I
lose
my
mind
It's
something
that
I'm
quite
sure
it's
fine
Read
my
mind
And
Time,
thought
only
time
can
kill
the
pain
Wash
away
all
my
sin
remain
God
knows
how
hard
I've
tried
in
vain
Let
it
rain
If
only
someone
can
find
that
paradise
Then
you
and
I
can
live
and
never
die
If
only
love
can
find
a
place
in
our
mind
Then
you
and
I
will
never
part
I
only
know
that
someday
you'll
read
my
mind
Then
you'll
know
that
I
love
you
I,
look
at
the
moon
I
see
my
crime
Thinking
of
you
I
lose
my
mind
It's
something
that
I'm
quite
sure
it's
fine

Read
my
mind
If
only
someone
can
find
that
paradise
Then
you
and
I
can
live
and
never
die
If
only
love
can
find
a
place
in
our
mind
Then
you
and
I
will
never
part
I
only
know
that
someday
you'll
read
my
mind
Then
you'll
know
that
I
love
you
The
day
is
breaking
and
I
can't
see
the
light
But
I
will
not
be
frightened
I'll
fight
till
the
end
Because
of
you
If
only
someone
can
find
that
paradise
Then
you
and
I
can
live
and
never
die
If
only
love
can
find
a
place
in
our
mind
Then
you
and
I
will
never
part
I
only
know
that
someday
you'll
read
my
mind
Then
you'll
know
that
I
love
you
You've
got
to
believe
me
that
it's
true
Then
you'll
know
that
I
love
you
