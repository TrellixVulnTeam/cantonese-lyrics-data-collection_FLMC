Brightest
Angerl
high
up
in
the
sky
Lady
Lady
Lady
You're
my
moonshine
Can't
get
you
off
my
mind
Even
the
loneliest
midnights
I
can
see
your
smile
by
just
closing
my
eyes
In
those
days
you
would
smile
for
me
Can't
let
go
of
the
memories
Be
my
guiding
light
like
the
moon
Then
I
can
go
on
Lady
Lady
Lady
You're
my
moonshine
Like
an
angerl
dancing
in
the
night
Lady
Lady
Lady
You're
my
moonshine

Let
me
be
on
your
mind
My
fellings
for
you
are
growing
stronger
Turned
in
to
tears
I
can
hold
back
no
longer
Only
if
I
could
tell
you
My
true
fellings
that
I
love
you
At
a
lost
for
the
right
words
I'm
afraid
to
lose
you
Never
thought
I
could
love
someone
so
deeply
and
gently
For
the
world
keeps
spinning
around
round
and
round
with
my
wounded
heart
