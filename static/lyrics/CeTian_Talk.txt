{感謝詞}{談話}
Under
the
great
North
star
Try
to
work
out
where
you
are
In
the
silence
of
the
sea
I
don't
know
where
I'll
be
In
the
future,
in
the
past
Going
nowhere...
much
too
fast
When
I
go
there,
go
with
me
When
I
go
there,
go
with
me
Cause
I
don't
know
where
I'm
going
and
I
wanna
talk
I
feel
like
I'm
going
where
I've
been
before
And
I
wanna
talk
Take
a
picture
of
Something
that
you're
not
sure
of
Bring
it
back
to
show
to
me
But
I
don't
know
what
I
see
In
the
future,
find
a
home
Getting
nowhere
on
your
own
Got
to
find
your
missing
piece
Cause
you
don't
know
were
you're
going
and
you
wanna
talk

You
feel
like
you're
going
where
you've
been
before
Nothing's
really
making
any
sense
at
all
You
tell
anyone
who'll
listen
but
you
feel
ignored
Let's
talk
Let's
talk
Do
you
wanna
talk
I'm
I'm
trying
to
sing
a
song
In
a
language
I
don't
speak
I
tried
but
I
can't
get
through
I'm
trying
to
get
to
you
But
you're
difficult
to
reach
Won't
you
talk
to
me
So
you
don't
know
were
you're
going
and
you
wanna
talk
You
feel
like
you're
going
where
you've
been
before
Let's
talk
Let's
talk
Let's
talk
Let's
talk
