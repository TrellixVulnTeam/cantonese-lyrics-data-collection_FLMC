Hill女聲：林楚麒(男)還要到那日
相信只有是你
可以這生依賴


如果真的可以
可以忘掉你
那會日日夜夜掛念(女)可否知只怕日後
相方都會發覺不快樂


兩個世界
問怎麼可以相戀(男)若是肯聽我講＊(合)Can't

試試彼此的真心(男)何以你默默無言望向天
彷彿積滿心事


不必擔心將會是晴還是雨
一天都必會開始(女)心知心知
但怎麼講起
心中的滋味(男)不可欺騙(女)今天分開
相方短痛好過(合)他朝痛悲(男)不必再相欺Repeat
＊(男)不可欺騙你自己
(女)別讓你我說別離(男)不管譏笑風裡飛
(女)只想再
只想陪住你(男)沒有熱情途中棄
(女)現在永遠交給你(男)傷心總會不記起
(女)到永遠
到永遠都一起(男)Can't
