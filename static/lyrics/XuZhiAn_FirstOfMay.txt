When
I
was
small
and
Christmas
trees
were
tall
We
used
to
love
while
others
used
to
play
Don't
ask
me
why
but
time
has
passed
us
by
Some
one
else
moved
in
from
far
away
Now
we
are
tall
and
Christmas
trees
are
small
And
you
don't
ask
the
time
of
day
But
you
and
I
our
love
will
never
die
But
guess
we'll
cry
come
first
of
may
The
apple
tree
that
grew
for
you
and
me
I
watched
the
apples
falling
one
by
one
And
I
recall
the
moment
of
them
all
The
day
I
kissed
your
cheek
and
you
were
mine

Now
we
are
tall
and
Christmas
trees
are
small
And
you
don't
ask
the
time
of
day
But
you
and
I
our
love
will
never
die
But
guess
we'll
cry
come
first
of
may

Now
we
are
tall
and
Christmas
trees
are
small
And
you
don't
ask
the
time
of
day
But
you
and
I
our
love
will
never
die
But
guess
we'll
cry
come
first
of
may

When
I
was
small
and
Christmas
trees
were
tall
